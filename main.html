  <h1>Climate Change</h1>
  <p>                                       For the past two centuries, Climate Change has rocked the world with increasing temperatures, animal extinction and political catastrophe.                                      </p>

<h1>Pollution</h2>
<div class="pd">
<p, id="pd">Pollution is the act or introduction of contaminating a certain space using objects/substances. Each year, there are 268,000,000 pounds of trash being thrown out across families in th e US alone. Of that 268 million, a whopping 44% of that is either not disposed of, or worse, not disposed correctly. Where does all this trash go then,
  well, into the ocean. Ocean pollution is becoming a common thing in todays world, with major rivers like India's Ganges River being almost unusable due to all the toxic substances inside the water. Every day, Garbage kills 273 ocean mammals. That is not even citing the dying coral reefs, which lose their once beautiful all because of their pollutants.
  But, the ocean is not defenseless, many people around the world organize communities dedicated to make the oceans, and the world itself a better place by cleaning up waste around the world. And you can too! It all starts with reaching out. See below to research organizations that help pollution not kill the water-bodies of our amazing Earth.

<h1>Saving Energy</h1>
<p, id="pd">Wasted energy is energy that is not being utilized or transferred. Wasted energy can be observed in our everyday lives, from our homes, to our office, and even the bathroom. On avergae, families in the US use about 10,982 kWh units of energy every year, which ends up to about $2,200 per year, which is dangerouly high for the enviornment. 
  On the bright side, people can lower these cost by following incredibly simple tactics. One common energy-waster is leaving lights in rooms that people are not. Simply turn off the lights in whatever room and voila! You can find more ways to save energy in the embeded below.
  But the main point is that Earth takes a toll on OUR energy consumption, but we can lower it incredibly easy. </p>

<h1>Greenhouse Gases</h1>
<p, id="pd">"Climate change describes a change in the average conditions over a long period of time. Scientists agree that the Earth has been getting warmer over the last century due to human activities that require burning fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal).
  Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide becomes trapped in the atmosphere (greenhouse gases) and  increases the planet's temperature. As the Earth's climate continues to warm the results can have big impacts on the environment (From ecology.wa.gov.)"
We can lower these gases by switching to renewable energy, which is not only healthy for the environment, but also for your wallet, as some states (Like NJ) will PAY you to switch to these energy sources. And it all starts with, YOU.</p>
